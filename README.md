# Stock portfolio and Property analyser

Team members: Shavan Patel, Kevin Chen, Arian Zehtab


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
---

This program is a combination analyser for both a stock portfolio and property investment

### Stock Portfolio Analysis:

To analyse your stock portfolio we will take in a csv of your stock trading history with symbols, date of trades, order type (buy/sell), and volume traded.
We will also need the initial value of your investment.

We will return the valuation of your portfolio over time, as well as chart your returns, and a box spread of your returns. The program will also calculate the standard deviation, and annualized standard deviation, as well as the sharpe ratio of your portfolio. 

### Property

To find details regarding your property, enter in your address and the purchase price of your property, and the program will automatically find the closest match for what you typed in.

We will show the median sale price and approximate number of properties sold in your suburb, and compare this against your purchase price
